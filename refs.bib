	abstract = {Small radio telescope of 21 cm was used for studying the partial solar eclipse, with magnitude 0.89, in Hong Kong on 21st June, 2020. The radio telescope SPIDER 300A was designed and constructed by the Radio2Space Company, Italy. Radio flux density time curves (light curve) and a two-dimension mapping of the eclipse are presented in this paper. Standard radio data reduction methods were used to obtain the intensity time curve. We also adopted the semi-pipeline method for the reduction of data to obtain the same results as with the built-in software of the radio telescope SPIDER 300A. The total solar radio flux of the eclipse was found to reduce by maximum 55±5\%, while the maximum eclipsed area of the same eclipse is 86.08\%. Other radio observations of solar eclipses in Hong Kong are also discussed in this paper, including SPIDER 300A observation of partial solar eclipse on 26th December 2019 (APPENDIX A); and small radio telescope (SRT), developed by the Haystack Observatory, MIT, USA, observation of 2020 eclipse (APPENDIX B).},

	abstract = {The Trieste Solar Radio System (TSRS) was used to perform radio polarimetric observations of the partial occultation of the radio Sun in the m-dm band at fixed frequencies (237, 327, 408, 610, 1420 MHz) during the 11 August 1999 solar eclipse. By comparing the theoretical eclipse curve of the optical disk with the observed radio ones for the LH and RH polarization components respectively, it was possible to derive an estimation of the radii of the radio disk at the different frequencies to construct theoretical radio eclipse curves. The comparison of the observed and theoretical radio eclipse curves is discussed with respect to the possible presence of solar radio sources.},

	abstract = {For centuries, the rich nocturnal environment of the starry sky could be modelled only by analogue tools such as paper planispheres, atlases, globes and numerical tables. The immersive sky simulator of the twentieth century, the optomechanical planetarium, provided new ways for representing and teaching about the sky, but the high construction and running costs meant that they have not become common. However, in recent decades, “desktop planetarium programs” running on personal computers have gained wide attention. Modern incarnations are immensely versatile tools, mostly targeted towards the community of amateur astronomers and for knowledge transfer in transdisciplinary research. Cultural astronomers also value the possibilities they give of simulating the skies of past times or other cultures. With this paper, we provide an extended presentation of the open-source project Stellarium, which in the last few years has been enriched with capabilities for cultural astronomy research not found in similar, commercial alternatives.},

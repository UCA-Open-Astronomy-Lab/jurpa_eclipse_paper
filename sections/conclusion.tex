Based on our comparison of data from a 2.3 m radio telescope, a broad-spectrum light sensor, an optical livestream, and theoretical data from \texttt{Stellarium} and JPL Horizons, our hypothesis that the radio solar disk is larger than the optical solar disk is supported.
This analysis found that the best-fit curve has an apparent solar radius of $R_{\mathrm{1420}} = 1.27 R_{\odot}$, falling between the results of other studies \cite{messerotti_radio_2000} and \cite{leung_solar_2022}.

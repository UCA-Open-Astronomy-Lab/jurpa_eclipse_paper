Based on our comparison of data from a 2.3 m radio telescope, broad-spectrum light sensor, optical livestream, and theoretical data from Stellarium and JPL Horizons, our hypothesis that the radio solar disk is larger than the optical solar disk is supported.
This analysis found that the best-fit curve has an apparent solar radius of $R_{\mathrm{1420}} = 1.27 R_{\odot}$.
Our result lies between the results of $R_{\mathrm{1420}} = 1.14 R_{\odot}$ found by Messerottie, et. al. (2000), and $R_{\mathrm{1420}} = 1.4 R_{\odot}$ found by Leung et. al. (2021).
In a future study, we will compare these and other results to examine potential sources of uncertainty in the measurements.

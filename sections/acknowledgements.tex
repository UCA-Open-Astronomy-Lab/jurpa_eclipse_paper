This research would not have been possible without the support of state and federal research grants. Funding to purchase the radio telescope came from the Arkansas Space Grant Consortium (ASGC) Statewide Equipment Award, matched by ASGC state match 20-ARMF-02. Funding to support student research and travel to present our results came from the ASGC Student Intensive Training award. These ASGC awards are subawards of NASA award number 80NSSC20M0106.

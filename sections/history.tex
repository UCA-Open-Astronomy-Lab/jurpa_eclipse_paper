Our results are consistent with the trend found in \cite{menezes_solar_2017}, which compared decades of solar radio observations taken at many wavelengths, and found that solar radius increased as the radio frequency decreased (their Figure 5 and Equation 2).
This was also seen in the results of \cite{messerotti_radio_2000}, who observed an eclipse at four wavelengths and found a similar trend.
